# Black and Scholes Model for Option Pricing and Greeks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the Black-Scholes model for option pricing, a fundamental model in financial mathematics. It provides an implementation of the model and the calculation of option Greeks using Python. 
(For more detailed information, refer to the [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) included in the repository)

The repository includes the following key components:

1. **Introduction to Options**: Explanation of call and put options, basic principles, and how they work.
2. **Valuation Methods**: Comparison of different methods like the Binomial Tree Model, Black-Scholes Model (BSM), and Monte Carlo Simulation, highlighting their pros and cons.
3. **Black-Scholes Model (BSM)**:
   - Overview and significance in finance.
   - Key inputs and factors influencing option pricing.
   - Implementation in Python.
4. **Assumptions and Limitations**: Detailed discussion on the assumptions behind BSM and its limitations.
5. **Option Greeks**:
   - Definitions and significance of Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho.
   - Implementation of Greeks using analytical formulas and numerical approximations in Python.
